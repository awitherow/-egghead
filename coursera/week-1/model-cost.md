# model and cost function

- supervised learning, given the "right answer" for each example in the data
- regression, predict real-valued output
- classsifaction, predict discrete-valued output (0,1)

## important notation for course!

**m** = number of training examples
**x**'s = "input" variable/ features
**y**'s = "output" variable / target variable
**(x, y)** = single training example
**(x<sup>i</sup>, y<sup>i</sup>)** = "i"th training example (i is index)
