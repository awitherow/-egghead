From Idea to Startup in 100 days.

## starting or joining a startup?

We are trying to make a decision on making a compoany, or joining an existing one.

Don't shoot for the Facebook or Google status, only 1% of seed funded companies becomes unicorns. It takes 6 rounds at least.

Disruption of incumbants is a large factor in the failures of startups.

Joining a company that is already in a successful state of growth that is growing rapidly and help it continue to exponentially expand, you will have a better chance of walking away with profit.

### motivators

|-|myth|reality|
|financial outcome|founder-sized equity stake is the best way to make a lot of money|higher prob of a good outcome by joining a growing company|
|impact|starting a company is the only way to get leverage|an established product and team aplifies your work|
|lifestyle|glamoroushigh stress, hard work|
|agency/control|you call the shots|everyone else is your boss|

### best reason

your passion and aptitude means you cannot NOT do it.

joining an existing project is still a great way to go.

### how to decide

Is it an addon, or is it something that people would be willing to adopt.

### challenge (differences from 2004 and today)

businesses are adapting, smart.

recruiting market is competitive.

costs are high.

### difference between a late/early employee

if you are there early, you have more stress/risk.

late employees get to draft.

### making your core team.

personal network.

good networking recruiters.

find a network where you/project is established.

### interest -> pathological obsession, what is an indicator of starting?

the further along to the pathological obsession, the better.

"the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now."

### finding a co-founder?

important, buddy to lean on.

if its not obvious, do not force it.

founder dating is not natural.

## summary

### silocon valley is special

- relentless belief in the future
- take wild ideas seriously. give 'em a thinking chance.
    - finding supporters is easier.
- no tall poppy syndrome
    - no one will cut you down.
    
### idea

- ideas need to be drafted out well first
- pivots resulted from new ideas, not having to resort to "adapting".
- notice problems in your own life, these will generate ideas.
    - allows you to "predict the great wave"
    - your peers toys are the next great wave.
- starting a wild idea is easier than an easy idea.
    - brings more passion

### co-founders
- a bad co-founder is worse than no co-founder.
- shared history is important
    - helps you keep going.
- determination is huge, the most important thing.
    - "startups are about not giving up" NARUTO!
- value matching is better than skill matching.
- humility is huge. non-entitlement, who are willing to do whatever it takes.
    - we have an idea and we cannot let it go!

### product
- small amount of users who love you is better than a lot of people who are semi-apathetic.
    - indicators: frequency of use, retention

### getting your first 100 users
- talk to your users!
    - drill in on what they like,
    - how they use it, 
    - where they do weird things (attempting something else),
    - ask on recommendations (why? why not?), 
    - paid? (why, why not?)

#### strategies

##### your network
- email people you know.
- call people you know.
- charge people!

##### targeting
- research your niche.
    - hacker news, forums, etc.
        - make this an ongoing process
    - buy ads on FB/Google (not recommended)

#### company
- get to know your customers well (do your own customer support!)
- how to iterate on customer feedback
    - talk to them
    - understand pain point
    - address that
    - get it in front of a user
    - see what they do
    - repeat
- 2% improvement over quick iterations is awesome.

> your top goal should be to build the fastest iterating company the worl has ever seen.

- make a long term committment, 10 years minimum.
    - start with the end in mind.
    - plan this way.
- keep small until you are SURE it is working.
    - then switch to scale fast.
    - do not hire mediocre people
        - the team you build is the company you build.

- startups are not all nighters
    - do not neglect yourself, your health, relationships, etc.

- **you need to have a very clear mission**
    - this needs to be clearly communicated, to get people to help you.

#### hiring order
1) values
2) aptitude
3) skills

#### getting good at getting good ideas

tell people your ideas, brainstorm them with people, bounce them off people.

Ideas are fragile. Don't let people them down, but find people who will take your idea and run with it and how to modify it to make it work.

#### fundraising, when to start?

if people are willing to give it.

if you really need it.

you need progress to warrent this funding.
    - it will be easy then.

#### searching mode -> scaling mode

it just comes to you.
